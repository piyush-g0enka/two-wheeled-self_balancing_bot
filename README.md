# 2-Wheeled Self Balancing Robot Project

## Overview

In this project, we have successfully developed a 2-wheeled self-balancing robot. The key mechanism involves measuring the tilt of the bot using an accelerometer and gyroscope, and then adjusting the wheel movement to counteract the imbalance. A complementary filter enhances the accuracy of the accelerometer and gyroscope readings.

Initially, we implemented a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller; however, complications arose due to the physical limitations of the bot. Subsequently, we transitioned to a Cascaded Proportional Derivative (PD) controller, specifically employed to regulate motor speed.
